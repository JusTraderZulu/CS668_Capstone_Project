# DQL Trading System HPC Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Deep Q-Learning (DQL) trading system has been restructured with modularity and portability in mind. This document outlines our plan to adapt the system for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments to enable large-scale experimentation.

## Current Status
We have successfully restructured the codebase with:
- Modular architecture separating agents, environments, and utilities
- Flexible command-line interface for all workflows
- Standardized experiment tracking and reporting
- Comprehensive documentation

## HPC Implementation Strategy
Our approach follows these steps:

1. **Initial Development & Testing**
   - Prototype and validate model architectures on local hardware
   - Perform preliminary hyperparameter optimization with small datasets
   - Identify the most promising model configurations

2. **HPC Preparation**
   - Create job submission scripts compatible with SLURM (or other schedulers)
   - Develop configuration files for experiments
   - Set up data and model synchronization procedures

3. **HPC Execution**
   - Run extensive hyperparameter tuning on full datasets
   - Train final models with optimized parameters
   - Generate comprehensive performance reports

4. **Results Analysis**
   - Compare model performance across configurations
   - Analyze computational efficiency and scaling properties
   - Extract insights from larger-scale experiments

5. **Remote Monitoring**
   - Implement Telegram notification system for real-time updates
   - Receive alerts for job completion, errors, and milestone achievements
   - Monitor training progress without requiring direct server access

## Benefits
This approach provides several advantages:
- Efficient use of computational resources (development on local, intensive computation on HPC)
- Ability to scale experiments to much larger datasets
- Parallel execution of multiple model configurations
- Consistent, reproducible results with proper tracking
- Real-time monitoring via mobile notifications

## Timeline
- Local development and testing: Completed
- HPC script preparation: In progress
- Initial HPC trials: Planned for next week
- Full-scale experimentation: Following successful trials

We are confident this implementation plan will enable us to efficiently leverage HPC resources to advance our trading strategy research.
